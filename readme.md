USER STORIES
***********************/

1) As a user, I want my program to display four quarter-circles: top left being green, top right being red, bottom right being green, and bottom left being white.

2) As a user, I want the game to automatically light up in a random sequence of quarter-circles, then prompting me to match that random sequence.

3) As a user, I want the game to allow me to progress to the next round only if I match the generated random sequence on my turn.

3) As a user, I want the game difficulty to increase automatically every round, beginning the game at one light, and increasing by one light each time I match the correct sequence

4) As a user, I want the game to reset if I mismatch the correct sequence

5) As a user, I want messages to display when it is my turn, when I have matched the correct sequence, and when I have failed to match the correct sequence.

6) As a user, I want a button to start the game, and a separate button to reset the game.
